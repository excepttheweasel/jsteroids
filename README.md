# jsteroids

## Background
While at Railscamp #8, I decided it was about time I learnt a bit of basic javascript with some jQuery and Raphael. So I ended up making a very basic asteroids simulation in a couple of hours.

### Controls
To control the ship, the W key accelerates, S decelerates, A and D rotate the ship left and right and the Q key fires rockets.

### Bugs
* Key input only seems to work in webkit right now.
* Wrapping is a simple repositioning of the path so doesn't look very good
* Some objects occasionally get stuck
